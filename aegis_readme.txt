What is Aegis Tunnel?

Aegis Tunnel is Amazon Tunnel with the Aegis cheat emulated using Ensemble Studios' xs scripting language.

What does the Aegis cheat do?
Almost everything should build and gather instantly, but note the following quirks:
Villagers are not created instantly at Town Centers
Town Centers do not work faster
Villagers do not gather from farms faster
Repairing villagers do work faster
Fishing Ships and fish traps were not touched

Where do I put these files?

"Aegis Tunnel v1.0.rms" goes in C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\AoE2DE\resources\_common\random-map-scripts

"aegis_v1.0.xs" goes in %USERNAME%\Games\Age of Empires 2 DE\<steam id>\resources\_common\xs

What do the locate-rms-folder.ps1 and locate-xs-folder.ps1 scripts do?
There are powershell scripts to create a shortcut to the folder in the current directory. They bring up a little gui browse folder dialog.
